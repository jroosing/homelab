# Homelab
This document describes my homelab setup which among others includes homepage, arr stack, plex and will eventually grow with other services such as uptime kuma, etc.

*DISCLAIMER:* This project is my personal project and there will be no support whatsoever.

## Homepage
[Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/latest/) is the dashboard from which I will access all my services.

## Mediacenter
Part of my homelab consists of a mediacenter revolving around the [arr stack](https://wiki.servarr.com/), [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) and [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com).

This setup is heavily influenced by [this](https://github.com/naralux/mediacenter) repo. Many thanks @Naralux for the base setup that helped me along the way.

See: [mediacenter.md](docs/mediacenter.md) for details regarding the setup
